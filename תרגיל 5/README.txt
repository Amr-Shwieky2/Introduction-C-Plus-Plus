The program contains a six-digit matrix, 
and the user is asked to enter values into each cell in the matrix.
The program compares the values and checks whether the number is
divided by the numbers before it without a remainder,
and the next number is divided by it without a remainder.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5a.cc –o ex5a
Run: ./ex5a
Input: 	entering six numper in array.

Output: how mine numper diveded by numpers before it without a remainder.

The program works on a request from the user six numbers
and checks them to see if they constitute a rise and fall 
in the formation of the six numbers and exits from any 
starting cell, and the number of cells to which the condition applies

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5b.cc –o ex5b
Run: ./ex5b
Input: entering six numper in array.

Output: output to any  starting cell, and the number of cells to which the condition applies.

 The program checks the number of prime numbers,
  the number of numbers divisible by 2, 3, etc.,
  and displays a histogram of the results.
   It uses a software module that has already been written,
   which knows how to create and display graphs.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex5c.cc –o ex5c
Run: ./ex5c
Input: entering tow numper .

Output: output displays a histogram of the results.(create and display graphs.)
