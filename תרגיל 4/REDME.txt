The program contains a six-digit matrix, and the user is asked to enter values into each cell in the matrix.
The program compares the values and checks whether the number is  divided by the numbers before it 
without a remainder, and the next number is divided by it without a remainder.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4a.cc –o ex4a
Run: ex4a
Input: 	enter values into six-digit matrix, each cell in the matrix. 

Output: number of digits  checked whether the number is  divided by the numbers before it 
without a remainder, and the next number is divided by it without a remainder.

The program works in the range of numbers from one to twenty-four, and checks the numbers as follows, if it 
is divided by two without a remainder,then it is divided, but if it is not divided,  the number is multiplied by
 three and one is added to it The process stops when a number is repeated or the number of the number
 reaches more than a thousand.


Compile: g++ -Wall ex4b.cc –o ex4b
Run: ex4b
Input:   the range of numbers from one to twenty-four
Output: numbers from one to twenty-four And all the complications that come from each number

 The program receiving 8 numbers to an array of 8 numbers, and start to locate a loop which means,
 checking numbers from left to right in the array, if the  first number points on a value, that if u point 
with it on another cell, and its value points on another cell etc, and at least the value of what we pointed
 at is worth to the number cell of the first cell we pointed at, itcalls a loop, we print the number cells which
 participated in the loop by order(with the help of another array).

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4c.cc –o ex4c
Run: ex4c
Input: receiving 8 int numbers for the array.
Output: the numbers of the cells which participated in the loop by the order.
