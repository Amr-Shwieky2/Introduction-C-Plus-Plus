This program solves the equation for the difference between the two inputs.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex1a.cc –o ex1a
Run: ex1a
Input: 	The three coefficients of the equation; 
            e.g. 5 -3 0 for the equation:  
num1-num1 , num1-num2 , num1-num3 
num2-num1 , num2-num2 , num2-num3
 num3-num1 , num3-num2  , num3-num3 

Output: presenting three numbers in three cases.
